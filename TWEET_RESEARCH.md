## Apollo.io — Email & Outreach

> Direct personal testimonial tweets from non-brand accounts were hard to surface via site:x.com search. Search kept returning official @useapolloio account. Best candidates from broader search:

Tweet 1: https://x.com/useapolloio/status/1949858410834325776 — [Official — SKIP: brand account]
Tweet 2: *(No clean individual human tweet URL surfaced — recommend manual search on X for: "apollo.io" from:founder OR "I use apollo" -from:useapolloio)*

**Fallback / Best available:** Search for `"Apollo.io" -from:useapolloio -from:apolloioindia` manually on X. Common testimonial pattern from GTM founders: "We use Apollo + Instantly to book 20+ demos/month."

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs manual X search — no clean individual-human URL confirmed from web_search.

---

## Instantly (cold email) — Email & Outreach

Tweet 1: *(Needs manual search: `site:x.com "instantly.ai" "booked" OR "cold email" -from:instantlyai`)*
Tweet 2: *(Common pattern: founders sharing cold email stats using Instantly)*

**Fallback context from web:** Instantly.ai testimonials page quotes: "I've specialised in cold email marketing since 2018... Instantly is hands down my favourite of them all." — but this is on their website, not a tweet URL.

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs manual X search. Suggested query: `"instantly" cold email "booked" founder` on X Advanced Search (2024+).

**Best pick:** Tweet 1 (Hiten Samtani — "I fucking love beehiiv" is the most quotable, authentic, zero-hedging testimonial; ideal for social proof)

---

## video-frames (ffmpeg ClawHub skill) — Video

> Niche ClawHub skill; no direct tweets exist for "video-frames skill" specifically. Best angle: ffmpeg developer usage tweets.

Tweet 1: https://x.com/wlmiddelkoop/status/1992114024239034813 — "I use the Apple Vision Pro to transform my living room into a development studio. Here you see me testing a responsive design and optimising video files using ffmpeg." *(Willem Middelkoop — genuine dev workflow)*
Tweet 2: https://x.com/hipreetam93/status/1950160316043579672 — "In the app - a user may upload a 2 GB file, on which I would need to run an ffmpeg command..." *(Preetam Nath — dev exploring ffmpeg in Next.js serverless context)*
